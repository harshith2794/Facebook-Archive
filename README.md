Facebook-Archive
================
Ever felt the need for a better way to search & archive posts/images/videos you've previously seen on Facebook. 
Ever wished there was a tool to archive posts without sharing/liking.
Then this is what you are looking for. 
A chrome extension to archive posts on Facebook. The extension appends an Archive option to every post and stores it as  you click on it.

Installation steps:

1) Download the zip & extract it.

2) Go to chrome->settings->click on Extenions(on top left in settings page)

3) Select the checkbox Developer mode

4) Click on the 'load unpack extension' button and choose the folder extracted

Thats it done. Once you login in FB, the archive option appears after the comment option in every post(except for some private posts).

Click on the archive option and the post gets added into your list. 
Access your list by clicking on the FaceBook icon (on top-right after the search bar)

Fix: Try refreshing the page if you are unable to see the archive option sometimes.

Once a post is archived the archive option is replaced with a 'Added to archive' option.

Bugs to solve: SYNCING the list with chrome account so that it can be accessed from any PC.
